 * @defgroup    mqttsn MQTT-SN - MQTT For Sensor Networks
 * @ingroup     net
 * @brief       MQTT-SN is an adaption of MQTT for sensor networks
 *
 * MQTT-SN caters to the needs of wireless sensor networks by reducing
 * message sizes and implementation state size reduction.
 *
 * ## Gateway
 * In order to connect to a regular MQTT broker, MQTT-SN needs a
 * gateway which converts between MQTT-SN and MQTT message formats and
 * saves some of the expensive state information.
 * The Mosqitto project includes an implementation of such a gateway:
 * http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/technology.mosquitto/
 *
 * ## Topic IDs
 * With MQTT-SN, topic ids are used instead of topic strings for
 * publish/subscribe messages. These topic ids can either be
 * dynamically retrieved from the gateway, or they can be prearranged.
 * In the latter case, the gateway would need to know the topic strings
 * which are going to be used. The corresponding topic ids the MQTT-SN
 * clients will use would need to be known at compile time, for example
 * through a macro definition the application uses as a topic_id for
 * publish/subscribe messages.
 *
 * ## MQTT-SN Specification
 * This implementation is based on version 1.2 of the MQTT-SN
 * specification:
 * http://mqtt.org/new/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/MQTT-SN_spec_v1.2.pdf
 *
 * ## API Usage
 * The workflow with this API is as follows:
 * - create and initialize the mqtt handle
 * @code
 * mqttsn_state_t mqtt;
 * if (mqttsn_init(&mqtt, ...) == -1) handle_error();
 * @endcode
 *
 * - connect (optional)
 * @code
 * if (mqttsn_connect(&mqtt, ...) == -1) handle_error();
 * @endcode
 *
 * - initialize a topic (optional)
 * @code
 * uint16_t topic_id;
 * if (mqttsn_register_topic(&mqtt, "example/topic") == -1) handle_error();
 * @endcode
 *
 * - disconnect (optional)
 * @code
 * if (mqttsn_disconnect(mqtt) == -1) handle_error();
 * @endcode
 *
 * ### Consumer
 * - subscribe to a topic
 * @code
 * if (mqttsn_subscribe(&mqtt, topic_id) == -1) handle_error();
 * @endcode
 *
 * - listen for publishes
 * @code
 * while (mqttsn_recv(&mqtt, &mqttsn_msg) != -1) {
 *     switch (mqttsn_msg.topic_id) {
 *         case (MQTTSN_TOPIC_LIGHTS_OUT):
 *             handle_lights_out();
 *             break;
 *         case (MQTTSN_TOPIC_LIGHTS_ON):
 *             handle_lights_on();
 *             break;
 *         default:
 *             break;
 *     }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * ### Producer
 * - publish to a topic
 * @code
 * while (msg_receive(&msg)) {
 *     mqttsn_msg_t mqttsn_msg;
 *     switch (msg.type) {
 *         case (SENSOR_STATUS_HI):
 *             mqttsn_msg.topic_id = MQTTSN_TOPIC_SENSOR_HI;
 *             if (mqttsn_publish(&mqtt, &mqttsn_msg) == -1) {
 *                 handle_error();
 *             }
 *             break;
 *         case (SENSOR_STATUS_LOW):
 *             mqttsn_msg.topic_id = MQTTSN_TOPIC_SENSOR_LOW;
 *             if (mqttsn_publish(&mqtt, &mqttsn_msg) == -1) {
 *                 handle_error();
 *             }
 *             break;
 *         default:
 *             break;
 *     }
 * }
 * @endcode
